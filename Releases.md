# 2.0.0

This is the _first official__ Release of the Rotorflight-2 Blackbox Explorer.

## Downloads

The download locations for Rotorflight 2.0.0 are:

- [Rotorflight Configurator](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases/tag/release/2.0.0)
- [Rotorflight Blackbox](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-blackbox/releases/tag/release/2.0.0)
- [LUA Scripts for EdgeTx and OpenTx](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-lua-scripts/releases/tag/release/2.0.0)
- [LUA Scripts for FrSky Ethos](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-lua-ethos/releases/tag/release/2.0.0)


## Notes

* Currently we don't have a maintainer for the Blackbox, hence it is receiving resuscitation only.

* There is a new website [www.rotorflight.org](https://www.rotorflight.org/) for Rotorflight-2. The old Wiki in github is deprecated, and is for Rotorflight-1 only. Big thanks to the documentation team for setting this up!

* Rotorflight-2 is **NOT** backward compatible with RF1. You **MUST NOT** load your configuration dump from RF1 into RF2.

* If coming from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch for RF2. Follow the instructions on the website!

* As always, please double check your configuration on the bench before flying!


## Support

The main source of Rotorflight information and instructions is now the [website](https://www.rotorflight.org/).

Rotorflight has a strong presence on the Discord platform - you can join us [here](https://discord.gg/FyfMF4RwSA/).
Discord is the primary location for support, questions and discussions. The developers are all active there,
and so are the manufacturers of RF Flight Controllers. Many pro pilots are also there.
This is a great place to ask for advice or discuss any complicated problems or even new ideas.

There is also a [Rotorflight Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rotorflight) for hanging out with other Rotorflight pilots.


## Changes

Rotorflight Blackbox is built on Betaflight Blackbox, with minimal changes to keep it combatible with Rotorflight.

A full changelog can be found in [git](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-blackbox/commits/RF-2.0.x/).
