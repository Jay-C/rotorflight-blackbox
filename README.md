# Rotorflight Blackbox

[Rotorflight](https://github.com/rotorflight) is a Flight Control software suite designed for
single-rotor helicopters. It consists of:

- Rotorflight Flight Controller Firmware
- Rotorflight Configurator, for flashing and configuring the flight controller
- Rotorflight Blackbox Explorer, for analyzing blackbox flight logs (this repository)
- Rotorflight LUA Scripts, for configuring the flight controller using a transmitter

Built on Betaflight 4.3, Rotorflight incorporates numerous advanced features specifically
tailored for helicopters. It's important to note that Rotorflight does _not_ support multi-rotor
crafts or airplanes; it's exclusively designed for RC helicopters.

This version of Rotorflight is also known as **Rotorflight 2** or **RF2**.


## Information

Tutorials, documentation, and flight videos can be found on the [Rotorflight website](https://www.rotorflight.org/).

* ESC telemetry protocols: BLHeli32, Hobbywing, Scorpion, Kontronik, OMP Hobby, ZTW, APD, YGE
* Advanced PID control tuned for helicopters
* Stabilisation modes (6D)
* Rotor speed governor
* Motorised tail support with Tail Torque Assist (TTA, also known as TALY)
* Remote configuration and tuning with the transmitter
  - With knobs / switches assigned to functions
  - With LUA scripts on EdgeTX, OpenTX and Ethos
* Extra servo/motor outputs for AUX functions
* Fully customisable servo/motor mixer
* Sensors for battery voltage, current, BEC, etc.
* Advanced gyro filtering
  - Dynamic RPM based notch filters
  - Dynamic notch filters based on FFT
  - Dynamic LPF
* High-speed Blackbox logging

Plus lots of features inherited from Betaflight:

## Notes

#### Windows

Rotorflight Blackbox requires Windows 10 or later. Windows 7 is not supported.


## Usage

Click the "Open log file/video" button at the top right and select your log file and your flight video (if you recorded one).

You can scroll through the log by clicking or dragging on the seek bar that appears underneath the main graph. The
current time is represented by the vertical red bar in the center of the graph. You can also click and drag left and
right on the graph area to scrub backwards and forwards.

### Customizing the graph display

Click the "Graph Setup" button on the right side of the display in order to choose which fields should be plotted on
the graph. You may, for example, want to remove the default gyro plot and add separate gyro plots for each rotation axis.
Or you may want to plot vbat against throttle to examine your battery's performance.

### Syncing your log to your flight video

The blackbox plays a short beep on the buzzer when arming, and this corresponds with the start of the logged data.
You can sync your log against your flight video by pressing the "start log here" button when you hear the beep in the
video. You can tune the alignment of the log manually by pressing the nudge left and nudge right buttons in the log
sync section, or by editing the value in the "log sync" box. Positive values move the log toward the end of the video,
negative values move it towards the beginning.

### Flight video won't load, or jumpy flight video upon export

Some flight video formats aren't supported by Chrome, so the viewer can't open them. You can fix this by re-encoding
your video using the free tool [Handbrake][]. Open your original video using Handbrake. In the output settings, choose
MP4 as the format, and H.264 as the video codec.

Because of [Google Bug #66631][], Chrome is unable to accurately seek within H.264 videos that use B-frames. This is
mostly fine when viewing the flight video inside Blackbox Explorer. However, if you use the "export video" feature, this
bug will cause the flight video in the background of the exported video to occasionally jump backwards in time for a
couple of frames, causing a very glitchy appearance.

To fix that issue, you need to tell Handbrake to render every frame as an intraframe, which will avoid any problematic
B-frames. Do that by adding "keyint=1" into the Additional Options box.

## Origins

Rotorflight is software that is **open source** and is available free of charge without warranty.

Rotorflight is forked from [Betaflight](https://github.com/betaflight), which in turn is forked from [Cleanflight](https://github.com/cleanflight).
Rotorflight borrows ideas and code also from [HeliFlight3D](https://github.com/heliflight3d/), another Betaflight fork for helicopters.

Big thanks to everyone who has contributed along the journey!
